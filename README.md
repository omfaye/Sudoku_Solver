# Sudoku_Solver
Sudoku Solver Project
Introduction
The Sudoku Solver is a program designed to solve any valid Sudoku puzzle. Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits (1 to 9) such that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids contain all digits from 1 to 9 exactly once.

This project utilizes a backtracking algorithm to solve puzzles efficiently and is implemented in [insert your programming language, e.g., Python, Java, etc.]. It accepts a partially filled Sudoku grid as input and provides a complete, valid solution.

How It Works
Input Validation:
The program checks whether the input grid is valid, ensuring no conflicts in rows, columns, or subgrids.

Backtracking Algorithm:

The algorithm iteratively tries to fill empty cells with numbers from 1 to 9.
After placing a number, it verifies whether the placement adheres to Sudoku rules.
If a conflict arises, the algorithm backtracks (removes the number and tries the next option).
This process continues until all cells are correctly filled, or it determines that the puzzle is unsolvable.
Output:

If a solution exists, the program displays the solved grid.
If the puzzle is unsolvable, it provides an appropriate message.
Key Features
User-Friendly Input: Accepts grids as a 9x9 matrix or via a graphical interface (if implemented).
Fast and Efficient: Solves most puzzles in milliseconds using optimized backtracking.
Error Handling: Detects and notifies the user of invalid or unsolvable puzzles.
